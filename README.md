# travel-resources
A list of travel resources to help people with traveling.
<h2>A guide to help people with traveling</h2>
The overall <a href="travelhelpguru.com">purpose of Travel Help Guru </a>is to help people get relevant tips and advice that will help them whenever they go on trips and visit somewhere new.
This can be achieved via helpful articles.
But the ideal long term plan is to grow the website into a growing database of resources such as sights to see, hotels to stay at, places to make reservations, etc.
For example, consider this article which details <a href="http://travelhelpguru.com/ways-to-get-best-hotel-deals"> existing solutions for making travel reservations</a>.
It would be nice to have these kinds of resources in a database for easy access.
An initial idea is to create such a database with Ruby on Rails and add to it that way.
We will keep you updated as we make progress with the site.
